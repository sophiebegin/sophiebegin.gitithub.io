    <h1> Current Fashion Obsessions </h1>
    <p> Fashion has always been one of my biggest passions in life.
      I love trying out new trends and finding new ways to spice up my wardrobe.
      This page is dedicated entirely to showcasing some of the outfits that I have put together using the latest trends. </p>

    <p>This is an outfit that I put together using trends I am loving lately.<br> Coret tops and statement boots are a huge trend for Spring this year.
      These are two pieces you need in your closet! </p>
